## Key Components

- **Identity**: Represents the digital identity of users, services, or systems.
- **Authentication (AuthN)**: Validates that the entity is who they claim to be (e.g., login with credentials or certificates).
- **Authorization (AuthZ)**: Determines what actions the authenticated entity is allowed to perform.
- **Identity Provisioning**: The process of creating, updating, and managing identity lifecycle across systems.
