# Identity Architecture & SAML Deep Dive

This repository contains structured notes, visual explanations (in ASCII), and markdown-formatted documentation exploring core concepts of modern identity architecture—especially within the context of enterprise security, authentication, and SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language).

## 📚 Contents

### 🔐 Identity Architecture

- ✅ Identity, Authentication (AuthN), Authorization (AuthZ), and Provisioning
- ✅ Session and Cookie-based authentication models
- ✅ User-role mapping in decentralized apps
- ✅ Security design flaws of custom identity management

### 🧱 Common Identity & Directory Services

- ✅ Centralized identity service models
- ✅ Integration with Active Directory
- ✅ LDAP: Protocol overview, structure, and operations
- ✅ Tree structure of directory services using `O`, `OU`, `CN`, and `DN`

### 🗂️ ASCII Diagrams

All visuals are converted into GitHub-friendly ASCII art to enable clarity and version control compatibility. These cover:

- Traditional web app identity flow  
- Fragmented identity across enterprise applications  
- Centralized identity service architecture  
- LDAP hierarchy examples  

## 🧠 Why This Repo Exists

In most organizations, authentication is misunderstood or poorly implemented. This repo aims to:

- Educate engineers, architects, and security professionals on modern identity concepts
- Highlight security gaps in DIY identity models
- Advocate for best practices using directory services and SAML

## 💡 Technologies and Concepts Covered

- LDAP / Active Directory
- Identity Provisioning
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- SAML & Session-based Auth
- Distinguished Names (DN)
- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Secure Enterprise Architecture

## 🔧 How to Use

1. Clone the repo  
2. Browse the markdown files in logical order  
3. Use the ASCII diagrams to visualize system designs  
4. Reference this in your design docs or technical presentations  

## 🛡️ Security Philosophy

> “Applications shouldn’t manage identities. Centralized identity systems should.”

Identity must be treated as a first-class concern. This repository emphasizes:
- Reducing developer exposure to credentials
- Centralizing trust anchors
- Minimizing attack surface across enterprise apps
